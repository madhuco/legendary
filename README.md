A work-in-progress framework, for creating beautiful experiences for all devices.

Full Details at http://framework.madhu.co/components


## Features & Goals:

This goals of this framework is to create a reusable set of interfaces, type styles, colours and layouts that scale across all devices.

Unlike other frameworks, which simply offer a striped down design for mobile, this framework tries to offer a fully immersive app like experience. 
 
Every part of the framework is broken up into small components which other elements build on top off. This means that every part can be overridden or mixed and matched for the ultimate in flexibility. 


## Project Status

This project is at an early stage. It's so early that it cannot even be considered beta!  

At the moment, the framework must be imported via [Codekit](http://https://incident57.com/codekit/) (As of yet, it can't be installed via the command line). 

Creating a complex framework like this involves lots of learning and there will probably many mistakes over the way. Therefore, I see this as a 'test' framework. Once I have used it over several projects, I will probably create a new version from scratch so I can implement all the knowledge I have learnt along the way.  

In addition CSS is undergoing some radical changes with regards to layouts, grids and images. By the time these changes become mainstream, a good chunk of this code can be streamlined and reworked for efficiency.
