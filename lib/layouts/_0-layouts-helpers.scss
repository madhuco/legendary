/*Each layout is made up of 3 components which are all provided as individual mixins.

Layouts mixin 

This provides the main functionality of the mixin

Grid Mixin

This provides the grid structure of the mixin. It can often (although not always) be made of several mixins including:

Mob-p - Mobile portrait version of the grid

Mob-l - Mobile landscape version of the grid

Fab - Fablet version of the grid

Tab - Tablet version of the grid

Desk - Desktop version of the grid

R - Stands for responsive. It combines all the different variations (complete with media queries)  into a single mixin, allowing complex layouts to be called with just one line of code. 

Styles

This contains a set of default appearance related styles of the layout, such as colours and text.

Combo

The combo mixin brings the layout, grid and styles mixins into a single mixin. Allows an entire page to be laid out and styled with one line of code.*/
